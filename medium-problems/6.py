# Write a program that takes array of numbers are input, print the second duplicate number and itâ€™s occurrence.

# Testcase1	:  [ 64, 1, 2, 7, 79, 7, 7, 1, 22]
# Output     	:  Second duplicate number is 7 and it is occurred 3 times
# Explanation	: In the given array [ 64, 1, 2, 7, 79, 7, 7, 1, 22], the second duplicate number is 7 and it is occurred for 3 times.

# Testcase1	:  [ 121, 8, 1, 4, 5, 4, 8, 1 ]
# Output     	:  Second duplicate number is 1 and it is occurred 2 times
# Explanation	: In the given array [ 121, 8, 1, 4, 5, 4, 8, 1 ] the second duplicate number is 1 and it is occurred for 2 times.
